# Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) Requirements Document

## Project Title: QuestScribe (a C++ text-based adventure game)

### 1. Introduction

#### 1.1 Purpose
*State the purpose of this document and provide an overview of the software to be developed.*
  The purpose of this document is to be a comprehensive overview of the requirements of this project. The software to be developed 
is a text-based command-line adventure game, written in C++. The game is to have complex memorable characters and a realistic yet 
exciting storyline. The software will have C++ classes for characters, combat moves, character personalities, items, and more. The
game will have a "choose your own adventure" element, where users' choices within the game will change the story, allowing more
replay value. The characters will also change in response to significant plot points in the game story. This game will combine two of
my primary interests - creative writing and C++ programming.
